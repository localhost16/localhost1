Welcome to my Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model repository! This repository contains implementations of CNN models for various computer vision tasks.

## About CNN Models

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep neural networks that are particularly powerful for image recognition and classification tasks. They are inspired by the organization of the animal visual cortex and are designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images.

## Models Included

### 1. LeNet-5
- A pioneering CNN architecture proposed by Yann LeCun et al. in 1998.
- Consists of a series of convolutional and subsampling layers followed by fully connected layers.
- Primarily used for handwritten digit recognition tasks.

### 2. AlexNet
- One of the first deep CNN architectures to achieve breakthrough performance on the ImageNet dataset in 2012.
- Consists of five convolutional layers followed by three fully connected layers.
- Introduced concepts such as rectified linear units (ReLU) and dropout.

### 3. VGG16/VGG19
- Developed by the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) at the University of Oxford.
- Known for its simplicity and uniform architecture, consisting of multiple blocks of convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers.
- VGG16 has 16 weight layers, while VGG19 has 19 weight layers.
